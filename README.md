Our project investigated the California Housing data set curated from Kaggle. The data was compiled from a 1990 California survey, providing information on a specified district in the state. The data describes homes in a district of California in 1990 in order to represent the larger population of this district during the 1990's. Some limitations of this data include the lack of data about individual houses and the individuals in each house. Each independent response corresponds to a different block within the district. 

Throughout our research, we investigated the following quantitative variables: `housing_median_age` (the median age of a home within a block), `total_rooms` (the number of rooms in a home within a block), `total_bedrooms` (the number of bedrooms in a home within a block), `population` (the total number of people living within a block), `households` (the total number of groups living within a home in a block), `median_income` (the median income measured in \$10,000 for households within a block), and `median_house_value` (the median house value (measured in \$) for households within a block). Furthermore, we consider the qualitative variable: `ocean_proximity` (the location of the house in regards to its distance from the ocean, categorized by less than an 1 hour, inland, near bay, near ocean, or island).
